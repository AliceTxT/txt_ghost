//---------------------------The User's Name--------------------------
//This .dic file has to do with setting the user's name and suffix/prefix. You may recall some of the functions mentioned here from bootend.dic. As you can see, you can spread functions across multiple .dic files if you like! Just remember my note in bootend.dic about the different between OnFunction and Function.

//This file is fairly short, so don't worry! It shouldn't take you too long to finish.

//Make sure to read the walkthrough (http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html) for more details about how to properly format ghost dialogue!
//I will reiterate that you should be editing these in Notepad++, and in particular, you should set the Language to C (or Java I guess) to properly highlight all the text. It will make things A LOT EASIER for you, trust me! It will also help you keep track of your brackets in case you forget some. If you click on a line with a bracket in Notepad++, it should highlight where the other bracket ends, or turn purple if there's no finishing bracket (which you should definitely fix!)
//It will also highlight my commented lines in green, so you'll know where they are. Any line beginning with // is a commented line that the code will not read. It's just for your reference!
